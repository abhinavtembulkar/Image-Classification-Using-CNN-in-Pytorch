# Image-Classification-Using-CNN-in-Pytorch
The aim of this project is to predict the label of the object given the image data using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) in Pytorch. The dataset used is CIFAR-10 dataset which is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class.

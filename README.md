# Image-Classification-Using-CNN-in-Pytorch

The aim of this project is to predict the label of the object, i.e., image classification on the given images dataset using **Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)** in **Pytorch**.

The dataset used is **CIFAR-10 dataset** which is a subset of the **80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class**. 

The **CIFAR-10** data consists of **60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images in the official data**. We have preserved the train/test split from the original dataset.  The provided files are:

**1.train.7z** - a folder containing the training images in png format

**2.test.7z** - a folder containing the test images in png format

**3.trainLabels.csv** - the training labels

The label classes with their respective indices in the dataset are:

**0-> airplane  

**1-> automobile 

**2-> bird 

**3-> cat 

**4-> deer 

**5-> dog 

**6-> frog 

**7-> horse 

**8-> ship 

**9-> truck

**PyTorch** is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as **computer vision and natural language processing**, primarily developed by **Facebook's AI Research lab**. It is a **free and open-source software** released under the Modified BSD license.
